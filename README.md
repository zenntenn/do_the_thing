Custom front end for Google Reminders

## Motivation

This app is ultimately meant to be usable by me, Joshua Hillerup.  I find Android Reminders to be increadibly useful, but the way the UI works on my Android phone is very much not to my liking.  I'm creating this app so that I can have a better experience using Reminders, but if other people want to use it to and even contribute that's great. 

Contributing to this project is fine, but if you end up wanting to take the design in a direction different from what works best for me I've made it under GPL v3, so it's easy to fork.
